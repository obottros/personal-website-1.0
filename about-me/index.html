         <p><b>Hello,</b><br />
           I’m Olivia Bottros a college student and a graphic designer. I’m 21 years old. Couple of years ago if someone asked me what I wanted to be, I would have stood silent, now I respond passionately with graphic design. Graphic design became my arena to vent my thoughts, a place where I could unleash my creativity. I have a great passion for illustration. However, that’s not where my passion stops. I have branched out in many directions and discovered my interest in many subfields such as typography and computer science. I have participated in the production of my high school yearbook in addition to various posters for events. I hope you find my portfolio satisfactory.</p>
