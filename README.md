# Web Design I - Final - Art Department - Queens College - Fall 2018

— **Before you start, read these instructions over multiple times.**  
— **Do not clone/download this repo — first fork it, *then* clone your fork.**

For your final project, you are to implement a web site rendition of the designs you created for the midterm. This web site should be a full implementation of your midterm designs, complete with working links, valid content, and responsive versions of all pages.

## 🧹 Validators
There are two code-checking/cleaning tools that you’ll need for this project: The W3C validator and Stylelint. You’ve been using the W3C validator since the beginning of the semester, but Stylelint is new. See below for installation instructions; skip the W3C validator if you installed it at the beginning of the semester.

### HTML
Ensure that you have the [w3c-validation](https://atom.io/packages/w3c-validation) installed.
1. Launch Atom.
2. Go to `Settings` | `Packages`.
3. Search for `w3c-validation`.
4. Install it.
5. Restart Atom.

### CSS
You will need to install a CSS syntax checker called [linter-stylelint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint) for Atom.
1. Launch Atom.
2. Go to `Settings` | `Packages`.
3. Search for `linter-stylelint`.
4. Install it.
5. Restart Atom.

If you want to check all the CSS you’ve written in class thus far, copy [`.stylelintrc.json`](https://gist.github.com/code-warrior/a766f7c32bab9a82b467601800b00a46) to your home folder. We’ll discuss in class.

## 📋 Instructions
* All CSS in the `css` folder.
* All `.jpg` and `.png` image files in the `img` folder.
* All JavaScript, if applicable, in the `js` folder.
* 🚫 No image file should be larger than 1MB.
* 🚫 Do not alter the file/folder structure of the scaffold. Just add to it.
* Only submit files that are required by your project: 🚫 Do not submit working files, such as `.psd`, `.ai`, `.indd`, or `.sketch` files.
* Use lower-case, combined with kebab-case, to name folders and files (`do-this` or `do-this.html`); 🚫 no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); 🚫 no camel case (`notThis`); and, 🚫 no snake case (`not_this`).

Note that HTML and CSS errors over-ride the cumulative nature of the grading scheme above. For example, if you scored a total grade of 100, but your code generated 20 errors in HTML and CSS, then your final grade would be 80. On the other hand, if you scored 100 and your project generated **no** errors, then extra credit would be applied to your midterm grade.
